<p> 9’s compliment generator

Since the final circuit is made for both addition and subtraction operations, I'm going to make a special circuit with mode selection. 2’s compliment method is used for binary subtraction. But in BCD it must be 9’s compliment method. As shown in figure I have designed 9’s compliment generator in the following manner. 

9 - B = X</p>
